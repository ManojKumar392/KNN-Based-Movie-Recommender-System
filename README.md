A movie recommendation system that utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to deliver tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset comprising movies, ratings, links, and tags, this project employs collaborative filtering techniques to identify users with similar movie tastes.

By implementing the KNN algorithm, this recommender conducts neighbor-based analysis to identify movies which have similar touch. Taking into account the ratings and tags of these neighboring movies, the system generates accurate and targeted movie recommendations. This approach enables users to explore a vast library of movies and discover titles that align with their unique interests.
